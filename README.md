## How to build

Zap for Android is not released yet. That's why you have to build it yourself.
1. Download and install Android Studio
2. Get an Android Device with at least Android 5.0 (Lollipop)
3. Enable developer mode on your device (7 Taps on build number, google it if you need to)
4. Enable USB Debugging in developer settings on your device
5. Clone the repository and open the project in Android Studio
6. Open the SDK manager in Android Studio and install the SDK according to your device.
7. Connect your phone to your pc and allow debugging from this device when the popup appears
8. Hit run and select your phone
